# THE-Rankings

## Goal

To understand which factors mostly affect the rank of a University, to see which countries contribute most to TOP100 Universities and to analyze how the THE Ranking 
had been evoilving in the last decade in terms of the number of universities and students included into consideration. 

## Project Overview

● THE (Times Higher Education) has been providing trusted performance data on universities for students and their families, academics, university leaders, governments and industry, since 2004. THE creates university rankings to assess university performance on the global stage and to provide a resource for readers to understand the different missions and successes of higher education institutions.
Our rankings cover the three main areas of university activity: research, impact and teaching.

● It is important to understand which factors affect the place of a University in THE ranking, which countries perform better than others in the ranking list and how THE ranking has been evolving with time
